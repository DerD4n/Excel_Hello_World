# Excel_Hello_World

this is a simple hello world program for excel-vb. it allows the user to run two macros using the developer tools.
The first macro opens a window that will display "Hello World!", the second fills the first cell of the first spreadsheet with the phrase "Hello World!".

To run the macros you have to activate the developer tools in your excel installation and start them via the macros menu or via the "Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications" window.


I got most of my inspiration and source code from here: https://toptorials.com/hello-world-mit-excel-vba-programmieren/
